### 1.2.1 Files in the library

#### **Figure 1.2.1: Directory structure of the library**


```
   build ðŸ“‚
    |- include ðŸ“‚
    |   |- POP ðŸ“‚
    |   |   |- POP.h ðŸ“ƒ
    |- lib ðŸ“‚
    |   |- libpop.a ðŸ“•
    |- LICENSE
```

 - The `build/` directory contains all the files that the library requires to function.

 - The `include/` directory is meant to be passed on to the compiler with the `-I` flag(e.g. `gcc -I /path/to/build/include/`). This is so it can find the library header.

 - The `lib/` directory is meant to be passed on to the compiler with the `-L` flag(e.g. `gcc -L /path/to/build/lib/`). This is so it can find the lib file to link against.

 - `POP.h` is the main library header, and it must be included with `#include <POP/POP.h>` it the file where you want to use the library .

 - `libpop.a` is the binary that is linked to your program. Make sure pass the `-lpop` flag to your compiler to link against it.

 - `LICENSE` Contains licencing information

### 1.2.2 Compilation Example
