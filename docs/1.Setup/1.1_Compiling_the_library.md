# POP Option Parser Documentation

## 1.1 Compiling the library

### 1.1.1 Prerequisites

You will need to install:
 1. The gcc compiler
 2. Make.

### 1.1.2 Get code

Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Dr-McFish/POP-option-parcer.git
```
Navigate to the correct directory:
```
$ cd POP-option-parser/dev
```

### 1.1.3 Compile

Run this command to compile:

	$ make release.

The all the necessary library files will be outputted to `POP-option-parser/build/`.
Done!

**NOTE:** This will produce a library that links statically. Instructions for compiling a dynamically linked library are not provided(at least for now) because it is OS dependent. However they shouldn't be different from how you would normally do this.
